# Leveraging NSE and OpenAI or any Large Language Model to ask pdf questions

This project uses the following technologies:
- ChromaDB
- Langchain
- OpenAI (No preference at all here)

This project highlights how to leverage a ChromaDB vectorstore in a Langchain pipeline to create *drumroll please* a GPT Investment Banker (ergh, I cringed as I wrote that, but alas it's actually pretty practical). You can load in a pdf based document and use it alongside an LLM without the need for fine tuning.
